I welcome strong candidates at postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels. Postdoc openings are dependent on potentially positive funding decisions on yearly basis. You will receive a reply if your background is a fit for following topics:

- multimodal scene representation for safe autonomy
- safe planning and control at interactive and dynamic environment, especially for driving
- intelligent and safe warehouse robotic fleet management

# PhD Openings
Please apply to the PhD programs at HKU-DASE and list Chen Sun as a potential advisor. I am looking for 1-2 self-motivated Ph.D. students to join my research group in 2026 Spring or 2026 Fall. Please note it is rather a highly competitive admission due to the global environment and the standards from HKU.

Successful applicants should meet the following criteria.

- Strong mathematical and/or programming skills, programming experience with ROS, pytorch prefered.

- A B.S. degree in related fields such as Automation, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering etc. 

- Good writing and communication skills in English.

Successful applicants are normally considered eligible to receive a Postgraduate Scholarship (PGS) during the normative study period. The basic level of scholarship is HK$18,760 per month. Outstanding applicants are also strongly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship scheme (HKPFS) and the Presidential Fellowship of the University of Hong Kong (HKU-PS), which offer a stipend of HK$28,100 per month plus a conference and research-related travel allowance of HK$14,000 per year. HKU will also provide HKPF and HKU-PS awardees additional living and accommodation support (HK$40,000 in the first year and HK$20,000 per year in the remaining normative study period).

# Masters and Undergraduates
I am also happy to host remote research interns for undergraduate students who are interested in applying for a Ph.D. in any country or region (Preferred Canada/China based). Please feel free to contact me anytime to discuss potential research projects that may be suitable for you.


We are interested in working with self-motivated students with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (e.g., applied math, optimization and control, statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms (e.g., drones, manipulators, ground vehicles).
