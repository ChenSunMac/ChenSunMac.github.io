# PhD Openings
Please apply to the PhD programs at HKU-DASE and list Chen Sun as a potential advisor. I am looking for 1-2 self-motivated Ph.D. students (funded/self-funded) to join my research group in 2026/27 Fall. Please note it is rather a highly competitive admission due to the global environment and the standards from HKU.

Successful applicants should meet the following criteria.

- Strong mathematical and/or programming skills, programming experience with ROS, pytorch preferred.

- A B.S. degree in related fields such as Automation, Statistics, Applied Math, Computer Science, Industrial Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering etc. (National-level Scholarship Recipient preferred)

- Good writing and communication skills in English.

Outstanding applicants are also strongly encouraged to apply for the Hong Kong PhD Fellowship scheme (HKPFS) and the Presidential Fellowship of the University of Hong Kong (HKU-PS). HKU will also provide HKPF and HKU-PS awardees additional living and accommodation support (HK$40,000 in the first year and HK$20,000 per year in the remaining normative study period).

# Masters and Undergraduates
I am also happy to host remote research interns for undergraduate students who are interested in applying for a Ph.D. in any country or region (preferred Canada/China based). Please feel free to contact me anytime to discuss potential research projects that may be suitable for you.


We are interested in working with self-motivated students with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (e.g., applied math, optimization and control, statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms (e.g., drones, manipulators, ground vehicles).
