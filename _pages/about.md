Hi! I'm Chen, an Assistant Professor at the University of Hong Kong, with appointments in the [Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering](https://www.imse.hku.hk/). Prior to joining HKU, I worked as a postdoc researcher in [Mechatronic Vehicle Systems Lab](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/) at University of Waterloo, where I work with Prof. [Amir Khajepour](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/akhajepo). 

My research interests include field robotics, autonomous driving (safe planning) and in general human-CPS autonomies. My research endeavors have been focused on addressing "How to improve the safety for the robotics and human-centered autonomies considering uncertainty and interactions?". My current research highlights the following perspectives:
- **Uncertainty Quantification** for perception modules and complex learning-based systems.
- **Safe Planning** interacting in dynamic environment considering social norms.
- **Fault Diagnosis and Prognosis** with model-data hybrid systems under uncertaintiies.

I led efforts on the <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/watonobus/">WATonoBus project</a> at <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechatronic-vehicle-systems-lab/">MVS Lab</a> working on software and algorithmic development of decision-making and safety monitoring modules required for <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/university-waterloo-launches-canadas-first-driverless">Canada's first autonomous shuttle bus</a> approved via the ministry's autonomous vehicle pilot. Additionally, I have expanded my research into argiculutral and warehouse robotics. Check out my [research projects](/research/) and [publications](/publications/).
